# Cave Story N64
This is a homebrew port of Cave Story to the Nintendo 64.

This project is based off my own decompilation efforts of Cave Story Freeware 1.0.0.6

Cave Story belongs to Studio Pixel (https://studiopixel.jp). English translation done by Aeon Genesis (https://agtp.romhack.net).

## Compiling
The makefile included is intended for CrashOverride's Modern SDK.

I attempted to create a makefile for the official Windows SDK (buildwin.bat and Makefile.win), however it doesn't produce a functional rom (and thus, unsupported atm)
